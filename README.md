As for this challange we need to help a client to evaluete credit card risk. Today "good" loans outnumber "risky" loans which creates unbalanced classes. We need to train and evaluate this classes. We will be using real life data from Lending Club, which is a lending money company. For this task we will use different libraries and techniques and decide which is more effective based on comparing accuracy score, presision score and recall score.

### Libraries
*imbalanced-learn
*scikit-learn

### Techniques
*Naive Random Oversampling
*SMOTE Oversampling
*Undersampling
*Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
*Ensemble Learners
*Balanced Random Forest Classifier
